Huff Curve Algorithim

The temporal distribution of rainfall is unique to each rainfall event, a phenomenon which
can be a critical determinant in the catchment response and characteristics of the resulting
flood. However, in design event modelling a hydrologist typically has only a few temporal
patterns available. Modelling is based on an assumption of AEP neutrality; however, several
recent high-profile flood events have highlighted inconsistencies with this assumption, with
potentially significant implications for flood risk managers (Stuart, Keogh & Hughes, 2016).

This paper describes the development of a web-based tool for visually identifying and
interrogating temporal patterns. Built in the software language “Python” and the “Shiny” web
framework, it allows a user to search and filter a database of publicly available rainfall
records containing more than 1,000 rainfall gauges, with over 10,000 years of total rainfall
record. 

The code has been reproduced in order to further implement changes originally outlined in 
Andrew Barker and Evan O'Briens "Making it Rain with Shiny, 2019".
